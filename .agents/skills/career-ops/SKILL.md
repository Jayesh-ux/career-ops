# career-ops -- Router

career-ops is a multi-CLI job-search command center. The routing below is shared across supported agent CLIs.

## Mode Routing

Determine the mode from `$mode`:

| Input | Mode |
|-------|------|
| (empty / no args) | `discovery` -- Show command menu |
| JD text or URL (no sub-command) | **`auto-pipeline`** |
| `oferta` | `oferta` |
| `ofertas` | `ofertas` |
| `contacto` | `contacto` |
| `deep` | `deep` |
| `interview-prep` | `interview-prep` |
| `interview` | `interview` |
| `eu-swe` | `regional/eu-swe` |
| `interview/plan` | `interview/plan` |
| `interview/practice` | `interview/practice` |
| `interview/debrief` | `interview/debrief` |
| `pdf` | `pdf` |
| `latex` | `latex` |
| `latex-tex` | `latex-tex` |
| `email` | `email` |
| `training` | `training` |
| `project` | `project` |
| `tracker` | `tracker` |
| `agent-inbox` | `agent-inbox` |
| `inbox` | `agent-inbox` |
| `pipeline` | `pipeline` |
| `apply` | `apply` |
| `scan` | `scan` |
| `batch` | `batch` |
| `patterns` | `patterns` |
| `offer-prep` | `offer-prep` |
| `titles` | `titles` |
| `upskill` | `upskill` |
| `followup` | `followup` |
| `update` | `update` |
| `cover` | `cover` |
| `add` | `add` |

**Auto-pipeline detection:** If `$mode` is not a known sub-command AND contains JD text (keywords: "responsibilities", "requirements", "qualifications", "about the role", "we're looking for", company name + role) or a URL to a JD, execute `auto-pipeline`.

If `$mode` is not a sub-command AND doesn't look like a JD, show discovery.

## Output Language Directive

Before executing any mode, read `config/profile.yml` if it exists and resolve:

- `language.output` → ISO language code for human-facing output. Default: `en`.
- `language.modes_dir` → optional market-mode directory. This controls market vocabulary and local evaluation rules only.

Inject this directive after loading the mode instructions and before producing any user-visible content:

> Write all human-facing output in `{language.output}` regardless of the language of these instructions or of the job description. This includes reports, tracker notes, PDFs, cover letters, outreach, interview prep, form answers, and summaries. If `language.modes_dir` supplies market-specific vocabulary, keep the market logic but explain terms in `{language.output}` when needed.

`language.output` is authoritative for prose. `modes_dir` is market context; it must not force the prose language.

---

## Context Loading by Mode

After determining the mode, load the necessary files before executing:

If `modes/_custom.md` exists, read it after `modes/_profile.md` and before the selected mode file. It contains user house rules and procedural preferences. It may override workflow/style defaults, but it never adds factual claims about the candidate.

### Modes that require `_shared.md` + their mode file

Read `modes/_shared.md` + `modes/_profile.md` (if exists) + `modes/_custom.md` (if exists) + `modes/{mode}.md`

Applies to: `auto-pipeline`, `oferta`, `ofertas`, `pdf`, `contacto`, `apply`, `pipeline`, `scan`, `batch`

### Standalone modes with profile and custom context

Read `modes/_profile.md` (if exists) + `modes/_custom.md` (if exists) + `modes/{mode}.md`

Applies to: `tracker`, `agent-inbox`, `deep`, `interview-prep`, `interview`, `regional/eu-swe`, `interview/plan`, `interview/practice`, `interview/debrief`, `latex`, `latex-tex`, `training`, `project`, `patterns`, `titles`, `upskill`, `followup`, `cover`, `email`, `add`, `offer-prep`

### Modes delegated to subagent

For `scan`, `apply` (with Playwright), and `pipeline` (3+ URLs): launch as a worker/subagent with the content of `_shared.md` + `_profile.md` (if exists) + `_custom.md` (if exists) + `modes/{mode}.md` injected into the worker prompt.
